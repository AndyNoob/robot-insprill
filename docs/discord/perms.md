# Permissions

---

Robot Insprill doesn't offer a way to configure command permission via the config.
For this, you'll have to use Discord's built-in permission management for integration commands.

In your server settings, navigate to 'Integrations', then click on Robot Insprill.  
![Integrations](../assets/integrations.png)

You will see a list of all commands.  
![Commands](../assets/commands.png)

If you click one of the commands, you'll see the required permission if it has one, and options to customize them.  
![Command](../assets/command.png)
