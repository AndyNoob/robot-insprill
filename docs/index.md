# Welcome

Robot Insprill is an [open-source](https://github.com/Insprill/robot-insprill) general-purpose Discord bot written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) with [Kord](https://github.com/kordlib/kord), initially created for CodedRed's Discord server.

It operates a little different from most bots. 
Instead of there being one bot that servers can invite and configure though a website, Robot Insprill requires one instance of the bot per-server, and is configured with a simple YAML config file.
